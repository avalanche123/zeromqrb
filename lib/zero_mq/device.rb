    # Starts the built-in Ã˜MQ proxy in the current application thread.
    # 
    # The proxy connects a frontend socket to a backend socket. Conceptually,
    # data flows from frontend to backend. Depending on the socket types,
    # replies may flow in the opposite direction. The direction is conceptual
    # only; the proxy is fully symmetric and there is no technical difference
    # between frontend and backend.
    # 
    # Before calling zmq_proxy() you must set any socket options, and connect
    # or bind both frontend and backend sockets.
    # 
    # If the capture socket is not NULL, the proxy shall send all messages,
    # received on both frontend and backend, to the capture socket. The capture
    # socket should be a ZMQ_PUB, ZMQ_DEALER, ZMQ_PUSH, or ZMQ_PAIR socket.
